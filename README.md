# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
## Week 9 Module

### Description
In this project, we implement HTML, CSS, and Javascript to generate a map that display the general area around MIT using 
<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> and a custom pointer that travels through 12 different points on the map.
This project also provided an opportunity to practice GeoJSON integration.

### Future Outlook
This project will most likely be revisited to test different marker styles, alternative icons, and color schemes.
